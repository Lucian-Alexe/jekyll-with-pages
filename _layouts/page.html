                                <h3>Traditional Psychotherapy</h3> <p> Traditional talk therapy gives you space to explore your thoughts, emotions, and patterns with clarity and compassion. Together, we look at what’s causing distress, what feels overwhelming, and where you want to grow. This approach helps you understand yourself more deeply and build coping skills that support long-term emotional wellbeing. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>EMDR</h3>
                                <p>Helps reprocess painful or intrusive memories—for example, revisiting a moment that still causes anxiety and transforming its emotional impact.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Brainspotting Therapy</h3>
                                <p>Uses eye position and focused awareness to access deeper emotional layers, such as unexplained tension that surfaces in stressful situations.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Body Movement & Somatic Work</h3>
                                <p>Because the body stores anxiety (tight chest, clenched jaw, shallow breathing), we use yoga-based stretching, breathwork, and grounding exercises to help the body relax so the mind can think more clearly. Always combined with talk therapy.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>A mindful cacao ritual that encourages emotional openness and grounding, helping you connect with intuition and soften emotional barriers.</p>
