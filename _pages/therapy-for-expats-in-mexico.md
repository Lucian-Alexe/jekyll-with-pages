intro: >-
  Moving to Mexico City is exciting, but it can also feel overwhelming at times.
  Whether you came here for work, to be with family, or just for a change of
  scenery, starting fresh in a new place can be harder than it seems.


  **_I get it_**. I’ve lived in the US, Europe, and now Mexico, so I know how it
  feels to adjust to a new culture and build a life from scratch. Missing your
  friends, feeling like a stranger in a new city, struggling with language
  barriers... these are things that really hit home. Or it might be that your
  family is taking longer to adapt. All these are real challenges.


  That’s why I offer therapy in both `English` and **Spanish** in Mexico City. I
  want you to feel completely supported, no matter where you’re from. My goal is
  to help you feel more at home here, work through the ups and downs of living
  abroad, and find peace in this exciting new chapter of your life.


  Prices are fully transparent, with the cost of a therapy session starting at
  MX$1000.

## Why therapy might be helpful for you

Living in a new country can be thrilling, but it can also bring up some tough emotions. You might be feeling:

*   **Culture shock**: it’s normal to feel disoriented as you adjust to a new way of life.
    
*   **Loneliness**: missing your old friends or the familiar things that made you feel at home.
    
*   **Struggling to build a new community** or find a place where you truly belong.
    
*   **Changes in your identity** as you adapt to a new culture and environment.
    
*   **Homesickness**: it’s hard to be far from the people and places you love.
    
*   **The stress of dealing with language barriers** or not fully understanding the local customs.
    
*   **Relationship strain**: whether with your partner or family, living abroad can put pressure on your connections.
    
*   **Anxiety** related to the uncertainty and instability of life abroad.
    

## Recommended therapeutic approaches:

Below is an overview of the therapeutic approaches used in sessions. Your treatment plan is always personalized, these modalities can be used individually or combined depending on your needs - including with the body movement therapy or other therapies.

*   Traditional Psychotherapy
    
    This is a chance for you to open up about what’s been weighing on you... whether it’s adjusting to life in Mexico, missing home, or just feeling uncertain. We’ll talk through your feelings, explore how you’re coping, and work together to build resilience.
    
*   EMDR
    
    If the stress of moving or life changes is overwhelming, EMDR can help you process those emotions. It’s especially helpful when you’re feeling stuck or trapped by your experiences.
    
*   Brainspotting Therapy
    
    This approach goes deep into the emotional side of things, helping you connect with feelings of being out of place or unsure of your sense of belonging here.
    
*   Body Movement & Somatic Work
    
    When you’re adjusting to a new life, your body can feel “on edge.” Through breathing exercises, gentle movement, and yoga-based practices, we’ll help calm your body and ease the tension that comes with living abroad.
    
*   Optional Cacao Session
    
    If you’re going through a big transition or struggling to find your balance, a cacao ceremony can offer a gentle, grounding ritual. It’s a way to open your heart and help you process emotions in a calming, spiritual way.

    ### Traditional Psychotherapy
    
    A 60-minute conversation (in person or online) where we unpack emotions, thoughts, and patterns in a supportive, grounded way. It’s talk-based, flexible, and can be combined with other therapeutic approaches when helpful.

    ### EMDR
    
    Offered both in person and online, EMDR can be woven into regular therapy or done as a focused series of sessions. We use gentle bilateral stimulation (eye movements, tapping, or sound) to help your brain safely process memories, beliefs, or experiences that feel “stuck.”

    ### Brainspotting
    
    A novel yet highly effective method available both in person and remotely. In these 60-minute sessions, we find a visual “spot” that helps your body access deeper emotional layers, and you simply focus on it while I guide you through what arises.
