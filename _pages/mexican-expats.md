# Mexican Expats Living Abroad

Leaving México brings opportunity and excitementt but often grief, longing, and identity shifts. Therapy offers space to understand these feelings and strengthen your emotional wellbeing. Having lived abroad myself, I deeply understand these layers.aaa

## Why Therapy?

Individual Therapy may be especially helpful if you are experiencing:

*   Homesickness and nostalgia
    
*   Identity shifts in a foreign culture
    
*   Pressure to succeed abroad
    
*   Disconnection from community
    
*   Cultural adaptation challenges
    
*   Loneliness
    
*   Stress from language or social barriers
    
*   Family-related guilt or longing
    

## Recommended therapeutic approaches:

Below is an overview of the therapeutic approaches used in sessions. Your treatment plan is always personalized, these modalities can be used individually or combined depending on your needs - including with the body movement therapy or other therapies.

*   Traditional Psychotherapy
    
    Traditional psychotherapy helps you navigate the layered emotions of living far from home, including homesickness, guilt, and cultural adjustment. We explore your experience with warmth and understanding so you can find balance, stability, and a renewed sense of identity abroad.
    
*   EMDR
    
    Helps process emotional pain associated with migration, separation from family, or cultural adjustment.
    
*   Brainspotting Therapy
    
    Accesses deeper emotional layers around belonging, identity, and transition.
    
*   Body Movement & Somatic Work
    
    Stress tied to migration often shows up physically. Through grounding, slow movement, and breathwork, we support nervous system regulation alongside talk therapy.
